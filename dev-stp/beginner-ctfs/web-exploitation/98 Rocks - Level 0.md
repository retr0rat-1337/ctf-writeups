Website with a basic Login Window with Username and Password.

With `' OR 1=1--` in username, we get access to the page and the flag.

The target was a simple web login form with two fields: username and password. No rate-limit, no CAPTCHA, nothing fancy. So the first suspicion is that the backend might be doing something like:

```
SELECT * FROM users 
WHERE username = '$user' AND password = '$pass';
```

If the input isn’t sanitized, you can break out of the query and force a true condition with a simple SQL injection payload in the username field:

```
' OR 1=1--
```

#### Explanation of the approach

- `'` closes the original string.
- `OR 1=1` turns the whole `WHERE` clause into a true condition.
- `--` comments out the rest of the query, so the password check is ignored.

If the application is vulnerable, the backend ends up running something equivalent to:

```
SELECT * FROM users 
WHERE username = '' OR 1=1--' AND password = 'whatever';
```

Since `1=1` is always true, the query returns the first user in the database (often admin).

#### Result

Submitting the payload instantly logged me in and revealed the page containing the flag.
