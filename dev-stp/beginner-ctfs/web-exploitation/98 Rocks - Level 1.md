The target was a simple web login page requesting username and password. No validation, no protections, nothing that would slow down a basic SQL injection attempt.
### Bypass the Login

Classic test payload in the username field:

```
' OR 1=1--
```

This closes the string, injects a true condition, and comments out the rest of the query, including the password check. As expected, it grants access immediately.

Based on [[98 Rocks - Level 0]].

### Post-Login Discovery

Inside the application, there was access to a “projects” database. The interface displayed only a truncated version of each column, claiming the full data was “restricted for security reasons.”  
That kind of message is basically an invitation to perform a UNION-based SQLi to dump the underlying table.


#### Step 1: Determine the Number of Columns

I probed the backend with incremental UNION payloads until the query structure became valid:

```
' UNION SELECT NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL--
```

Once the server stopped throwing errors, I knew how many columns the original query returned.  
In this case: **5 columns**.
#### Step 2: Dumping the Full Table

To extract the real content, I used a UNION payload tailored to the number of columns in the original query ve in this case). The goal was to replace one of the visible columns with the sensitive value I wanted:

```
' UNION SELECT secret_notes, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL 
FROM projects 
WHERE id = 4 --
```

Breakdown:

- The leading `'` escapes the original value.
- `UNION SELECT` merges our custom row into the result set.
- `secret_notes` is the column containing the hidden data.
- The `NULL`s fill the remaining columns so the SELECT structure matches.
- `WHERE id = 4` targets the specific entry holding the flag.
- `--` comments out whatever remains of the original query.

#### Result

The application processed the UNION as if it were a normal entry and displayed the entire `secret_notes` field without truncation. That contained the flag.

If you want, I can also turn this into a more formal writeup style (with query diagrams, sanitized screenshots, etc.) or help you build a reusable template for future CTF writeups.
